## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Excitement and anticipation for upcoming travel
- **Design Personality**: Modern, trustworthy, and slightly premium
- **Visual Metaphors**: Flight paths, city skylines, travel journey progression
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Clean interface with purposeful animations

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Complementary (opposite colors)
- **Primary Color**: Deep Travel Blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 250)) - Communicates trust and reliability
- **Secondary Colors**: Sky Blue (oklch(0.75 0.12 240)) for backgrounds
- **Accent Color**: Vibrant Orange (oklch(0.65 0.18 50)) for CTAs and important elements
- **Color Psychology**: Blues for trust, oranges for energy and excitement
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (White): Dark Blue text - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue): White text - Ratio 6.8:1 ✓
  - Accent (Orange): White text - Ratio 4.9:1 ✓

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Single family (Inter) with varying weights
- **Primary Font**: Inter - Modern, highly legible sans-serif
- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Main Status): Inter Bold/32px/tight spacing
  - H2 (Section Labels): Inter Medium/18px/normal spacing
  - Body (Progress Text): Inter Regular/14px/relaxed spacing
  - Caption (Percentages): Inter Medium/12px/wide spacing

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Motion communicates travel journey progression
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Primary focus on flight paths and hotel scanning
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Smooth, physics-based motion that mirrors real travel

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Components**: Card for main container, Progress components, custom animated elements
- **Component States**: Loading (active), Progress (updating), Complete (success)
- **Icon Selection**: Airplane, Buildings, MapPin, Clock, CheckCircle from Phosphor Icons
- **Spacing System**: Generous padding (p-8) with consistent gaps between sections
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Single-column layout with optimized animations

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Network Issues**: Graceful error states with retry options
- **Mobile Performance**: Optimized animations for lower-end devices
- **Accessibility**: Reduced motion options for users with vestibular disorders

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Modular animation components for reuse
- **Testing Focus**: Animation performance across devices
- **Critical Questions**: Balancing visual appeal with performance
